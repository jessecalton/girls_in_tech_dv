# Bay Area Help

Hackathon project for Girls in Tech related to helping victims of domestic violence

We are dedicated to helping victims of domestic abuse develop a safety plan, escape their abusers, and live fulfilling and abuse-free lives. We aim to put victims in touch with needed resources, by making resources easy to find, and providing helpful advice along the way.
