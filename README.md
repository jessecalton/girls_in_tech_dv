# Bay Area Help

### This project was built by a team of 5 engineers and designers during a hackathon hosted by [Hacking For Humanity and Girls in Tech](http://hackingforhumanity.girlsintech.org/) üë©‚Äçüé§

### About 
* Built for domestic abuse victims who may have been denied regular computer access and the right to private browsing.

* We designed with a focus on user-friendliness and privacy, thus the site is free of any persistent data, and is kept to one dynamically-loading page.

* Provides an escape button that reroutes the user to weather.com and disables the browser's back button.
